# Launching Your Site

8.  **Launching Your Site**

Once you are satisfied with the edits you made to the website, it is
time to launch the site. Launching means that you release your edited
website onto the internet. You can find your website link in two places.
The first way is under the Actions tab.



If you have a green check mark next to "pages build and deployment" it
means that your code works, and your website is ready to be viewed.
Click on "pages build and deployment". Click on the link under "deploy"
and your website should open up in a new window.



The second way is under Settings and Pages.
